@section{plot-container% Class}

@defmodule[plot-container]

@defclass[plot-container% editor-canvas% ()]{

  The @racket[plot-container%] class is a GUI container that can be used to
  embed plots produced by @racket[plot-snip] in GUI applications. It supports
  building interactive GUI applications which display plot data, especially
  when combined with using the @racket[2d-plot-snip%]'s
  @racket[set-mouse-event-callback] method to install on-hover callbacks for
  the plots.  The container has the following features:

  @bold{Plot snips} will be arranged in rows and columns such that each occupy
  an equal amount of space -- i.e. all snips have the same size.  The snips
  will be resized dynamically if the container itself changes size or new
  snips are added.  The number of columns is specified when the
  @racket[plot-container%] is instantiated and the number of rows will be
  calculated based on the number of snips and the column count.  The plot
  snips must be any @racket[snip%], but this container class was originally
  intended to display plots produced by @racket[plot-snip], thus its name.
  Plot snips can be added using the @racket[add-plot-snip],
  @racket[set-plot-snip] or @racket[set-plot-snips] methods.

  @bold{Floating snips} will show up on top of the plot snips and are not
  placed in rows and columns, instead the user can drag them around and they
  can be used to display additional information, such as a plot legend.  Use
  @racket[add-floating-snip] and @racket[set-floating-snip] to add floating
  snips.  Just as with the plot snips, any @racket[snip%] object is a valid
  floating snip, in particular @racket[pict-snip%] instances are useful for
  constructing images based on the pict package.

  A @bold{background message} can be set up to be shown when the plot
  container is empty, see @racket[set-background-message].  This is useful, as
  the contents of the plot container can be changed dynamically at runtime.

  A @bold{floating snip} can be added using @racket[set-hover-pict] or
  @racket[set-hover-pict-at-mouse-event].  This is intended to support
  implementing tooltips or displaying additional information when the user
  hovers the mouse over various plot elements.

  @defconstructor[([parent (or/c (is-a?/c frame%) (is-a?/c dialog%)
                                 (is-a?/c panel%) (is-a?/c pane%))]
                   [columns positive-integer? 1]
                   [spacing positive-integer? 5])]{

    Create a new instance of a @racket[plot-container%] which will arrange
    plot @racket[snip%] objects in @racket[columns] columns with
    @racket[spacing] pixels between them.  The number of rows will be
    determined by the number of plot snips added.  Additional init argyments
    can be passed in, they will all go to the @racket[editor-canvas%] class,
    see its documentation for what options are available.

  }

  @defmethod[(cell-dimensions [snip-count positive-integer?])
             (values real? real?)]{

    Return the dimensions of a plot snip when this @racket[plot-container%]
    would hold @racket[snip-count] snips.  The dimensions will be calculated
    based on the current size of the canvas plus the number of columns and
    spacing between snips.

    This method can be used to construct the plot snip instances with the
    correct dimensions and avoid a snip resize operation when these snips are
    added to the container.

  }

  @defmethod[(clear-all) any/c]{

    Clear all snips from the container.

  }

  @defmethod[(add-plot-snip [snip (is-a?/c snip%)]) any/c]{

    Add @racket[snip] to the list of snips managed by the container.  All the
    existing snips will be resized to make room for the new snip.

  }

  @defmethod[(set-plot-snip [snip (is-a?/c snip%)]) any/c]{

    Set @racket[snip] as the only snip managed by the container, replacing any
    previous plot snips.

  }

  @defmethod[(set-plot-snips [snip (is-a?/c snip%)] ...) any/c]{

    Set the contents of the container to the @racket[snip] instances passed in
    as paramters, replacing any previous plot snips.

    If you need to add multiple snips to the container, it is better to use
    this method instead of calling @racket[add-plot-snip] repeteadly, because
    this method will only resize the snips once for the final layout.

  }

  @defmethod[(add-floating-snip [snip (is-a?/c snip%)] [x real?] [y real?]) any/c]{

    Add @racket[snip] as a @italic{floating snip} to the container and place
    it at @racket[x], @racket[y].  Any previous floating snips will be kept as
    well.

  }

  @defmethod[(set-floating-snip [snip (is-a?/c snip%)] [x real?] [y real?]) any/c]{

    Remove all existing @italic{floating snips}, than add @racket[snip] as a
    @italic{floating snip} to the container and place it at @racket[x],
    @racket[y].

  }

  @defmethod[(set-background-message [message (or/c #f string?)]) any/c]{

    Set a @racket[message] to be displayed in the plot container when it
    contains no snips at all.  If the message is @racket[#f], no message will
    be displayed.

  }

  @defmethod[(set-hover-pict [pict (or/c #f pict?)] [x real?] [y real?]) any/c]{

    Set @racket[pict] to be displayed at locations @racket[x], @racket[y], or
    hide the pict when @racket[#f].  The pict will be displayed on top of all
    other snips in the container and can be used to implement tool tips for
    the contents of the container.

  }

  @defmethod[(set-hover-pict-at-mouse-event [pict (or/c #f pict?)]
                                            [event (is-a?/c mouse-event%)])
             any/c]{
    Display @racket[pict] at the location of the mouse @racket[event].  This
    method will take the mouse event coordinates, convert them to plot
    container coordinates and call @racket[set-hover-pict].

  }

}

@section{Some utility functions to use with plots and plot containers}

@defmodule[plot-container/hover-util]

This module provides a collection of helper functions for building interactive
plots.  The @racket[plot-snip] function returns a @racket[snip%] representing
the plot, and this snip has two additional methods
@racket[set-mouse-event-callback] and @racket[set-overlay-renderers] which
help with this. See the plot documentation for @racket[2d-plot-snip%] for more
details.

@defproc[(good-hover? [snip (is-a?/c snip%)]
                      [x (or/c real? #f)]
                      [y (or/c real? #f)]
                      [event (is-a?/c mouse-event%)])
         boolean?]{

  Return @racket[#t] when the @racket[x], @racket[y] and @racket[event] passed
  to a plot snip mouse callback are valid, and hover information should be
  displayed for the point at @racket[x], @racket[y].

  The parameters are considered valid when the coordinates @racket[x] and
  @racket[y] are not @racket[#f], the mouse event is a motion event and the
  plot @racket[snip] is directly under the mouse with no other snips above it.

  The @racket[x], @racket[y] coordinates can be @racket[#f] when they are
  inside the plot snip but not on the plot itself, for example in the axes
  area.

  This function encapsulates all the logic on whether to add or clear overlay
  renderers from a plot, and allows writing hover callbacks in the following
  form:

  @; NOTE apparently the indentation of the block below is also kept in the
  @; resulting document.

@#reader scribble/comment-reader
(racketblock
(define (hover-callback snip event x y)
  (if (good-hover? snip x y event)
    ;; Need to add overlay renderers for position x,y
    (send snip set-overlay-renderers ...)
    ;; Nedd to clear any overlay renderers
    (send snip set-overlay-renderers #f))))

}

@defproc[(xposition->histogram-slot [xposition number?]
                                    [skip number? (discrete-histogram-skip)]
                                    [gap number? (discrete-histogram-gap)])
         (values (or/c #f exact-nonnegative-integer?)
                 (or/c #f exact-nonnegative-integer?))]{

  Convert the @racket[xposition] received by the hover callback in a histogram
  plot back to the series and the slot withing that series.  @racket[skip] and
  @racket[gap] are the @racket[#:skip] and @racket[#:gap] arguments passed to
  the @racket[discrete-histogram] renderer, they default to
  @racket[discrete-histogram-gap] and @racket[discrete-histogram-skip]
  parameters, just as they do for the @racket[discrete-histogram] renderer.

  Returns two values, the series, when multiple historams are plotted and the
  slot within that histogram.  Will return @racket[(values #f #f)] if the X
  position is between the bars of the histogram.
}

@defproc[(get-snip-location [snip (or/c #f (is-a?/c snip%))])
         (or/c #f (cons/c number? number?))]{

  Return the location of @racket[snip] as a @racket[(cons X Y)], or return
  @racket[#f] if @racket[snip] is not added to an editor.

  Together with @racket[move-snip-to], this function can be used to retrieve
  and save the location of any hover snips in a @racket[plot-container%] and
  restore them at a later time.
}

@defproc[(move-snip-to [snip (is-a?/c snip%)]
                       [location (or/c #f (cons/c number? number?))])
         any/c]{

  Move @racket[snip] to @racket[location], adjusting it as necessary to remain
  fully visible inside the canvas.  This is intended to be used with locations
  retrieved by @racket[get-snip-location] and unlike the
  @racket[plot-container%]'s @racket[add-floating-snip], this function will
  adjust the location so that the snip visible in the container -- this is
  useful if the container has changed size since the location was retrieved
  and saved.

  Assumes the @racket[snip] is added to an editor.
